## TITANYAN Acc & Internal Audit – One-Page Website

Static site located in the same directory (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`). It includes Armenian, English, and Russian content with a language switcher.

### Getting Started
- Place the official logo at `assets/logo.png`. The image is used in both the navigation bar and hero section.
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the folder with any static file server.
- Customize colors or typography in `styles.css`.
- Update translations or add new ones in `script.js` inside the `translations` object.

For production hosting, deploy the folder to any static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
